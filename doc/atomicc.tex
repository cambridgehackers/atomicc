\rSec1[atomicc.intro]{Introduction}

AtomicC is a timed, structural hardware description language, permitting
the high level specification of algorithms to be instantiated
directly in hardware.
AtomicC is structural in that all state elements in the hardware
netlist are explicit in the source code of the design.
AtomicC follows in the tradition of the Go language,
promoting the use of interfaces when performing composition and
coupling rather than using inheritance \cite{Pike2012}.
Separate compilation of modules promotes the safe use of pre-compiled, validated
libraries, improving productivity on large projects.
The AtomicC compiler 
generates a single Verilog module for each AtomicC module declared.
Standard Verilog backend tools are then used to create the netlist and synthesize
the resulting ASIC or FPGA.

AtomicC extends C++
with Bluespec-style\cite{Bluespec:www,Hoe:Thesis,HoeArvind:TRS_Synthesis2}
modules, rules, interfaces, and methods.
AtomicC does not attempt to emulate the behavior of all C++ constructs in hardware.
Instead, it uses a subset of the C++ language to specify desired
conditional assignments to state elements,
performing these operations under an atomic transaction rule-based execution model.
In AtomicC, all module data is private; an instantiator of a module can only 
interact with it via method invocations.

Like Connectal, AtomicC designs may include both hardware and
software components, using interfaces to specify hardware/software communication
in a type safe way. The AtomicC compiler generates the code and transactors to pass
arguments between hardware and software.

The basic building block of AtomicC is the module declaration.
Modules consist of 3 parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Instantiation of state elements used by the module,
\item Interface declarations for interacting from other modules,
\item Rules, which group assignment statements and method invocations into atomic transactions.
\end{itemize}

\rSec1[atomicc.interface]{Interfaces}
Instantiated modules are interacted with using one or more interfaces exported by the module.
An interface definition is a list of method signatures, but no method bodies, defining
an abstract data type(ADT) \cite{Liskov74programmingwith}.
Module interfaces are named, 
allowing explicit denotation in the program text
of which ADTs are connected to and accessable from other state elements.
In addition to defining and exporting interfaces,
a module definition can also import
interface references, exported from an
externally defined module.

There are 2 types of methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Value method functions} provide read-only access to module state elements.
\item \textbf{Action method procedures} perform transactions on state elements
and do not have a return value.
Parameters are used to pass transaction data to the instantiated module.
A compiler generated
\textbf{valid} signal indicates that the caller wishes to perform the method invocation.
\end{itemize}

Both types of methods use a compiler generated \textbf{ready} signal
to indicate when the callee is available and
to prevent scheduling of the calling transaction until all necessary elements are
available.

AtomicC uses a \textbf{valid/ready} handshake process\cite{Fletcher2009, AXISpec} to invoke action methods,
giving both the invoker(master) and invokee(slave) the ability to control the progress of execution.
The master uses the \textbf{valid} signal
of the method to show when parameter data is available and the transaction should be performed
The method invocation transaction succeeds only when
both \textbf{valid} and \textbf{ready} are HIGH ($\pi(M_{i}) \equiv ready(M_{i})\ \&\&\ valid(M_{i})$).

Exported interfaces can be used in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item invoked directly by the instantiator of the module,
\item forwarded transparently, becoming another exported interface of the instantiating module,
\item 'connected' to an 'interface reference' of another module in the instantiating scope.
\end{itemize}

\rSec1[atomicc.modrule]{Rules}
In AtomicC, all enabled statements in all modules execute on every clock cycle.
These executions are atomic transactions: internal states in the rule
execution are not visible to other rules.
The compiler synthesizes control signals that allow rules to fire
only when their dependant elements are ready and validates that all enabled
rules in any cycle are
"equivalent" to some legal sequentially consistent (SC)
computation \cite{Lamport:1979:MMC:1311099.1311750}.
Even though all concurrent rules are executed during the same clock cycle, SC allows us to compute the
outcome of each rule independantly of any other rules that could be executing at the same time.

\rSec1[atomicc.schedule]{Scheduling}

The AtomicC compiler verifies that it is valid to consider
all rules executed during a given clock cycle
as if they were serialized into a linear, atomic ordering ("sequentially consistent"(SC)).

Each rule has a set of state elements that it reads and another set of element that it writes.
Value method invocations are treated as reads; action method invocations are treated as writes.
For the execution of a group of rules to be considered to be SC, the following must
be true:
\begin{itemize}
\item Atomic: All read and write operations for a given rule occur at the same time point in the sequence.
\item Read-before-write:  A rule that writes a state element must occur later in the sequence
than any rules that read the same state element.
\item Non-conflicting: A given state element cannot be written by more than one concurrently executable rule.
\end{itemize}

The compiler statically determines the 'read' and 'write'
footprint for every rule and method.
\begin{itemize}
\item read set: $R_{i}.read$
\item write set: $R_{i}.write$
\item sensitivity set: $S(R_{i}) \equiv R_{i}.read \cup R_{i}.write$
\end{itemize}

The compiler and linker do not break SC violations automatically.
If static compile analysis cannot prove that their execution conditions(guards) or
effects(sensitivity sets) are always disjoint,
then the source text of the program must specify the priority order of scheduling
to resolve conflicts.

\rSec2[atomicc.schedalg]{Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item arc condition: $arcCond(uv) \equiv
\newline
      fold (|, \{ \forall E \in u.Write, E \in v.Read \colon (u.Write(E).cond\ \&\ v.Read(E).cond) \})$
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
$WorkSet$ = { all rules and methods for module }
for $r \in WorkSet$ do
    // Greedily group all rules/methods that have some overlap in read/write sets
    $V = \{ r \}$
    $V = \{ E \vert S(E) \cap S(V) \neq \varnothing  \}$  // Create next schedule set
    $WorkSet = WorkSet \setminus V$

    // Create 'read-before-write' digraph
    $G = (V, E)$
    where: 
       $V$ is a set of vertices
       $E$ is a set of arcs $==$ { uv $\vert$ arcCond(uv) is not identically false }

    // Find loops
    $L$ = loops in $G$

    for $L \in G$ do
       if fold (&, { $\forall uv \in L \colon$ arcCond(uv)}) is not identically false
          // 'break' loop L
          if loop has some method $M$ & some rule $R$
              $valid(R)$ &= $\neg valid(M)$
          else if source code has "priority $R1 > R2$" & $R1 \in L$ & $R2 \in L$
              $valid(R2)$ &= $\neg valid(R1)$
          else
              loop still exists, report error
\end{lstlisting}

\rSec2[atomicc.schedlink]{Linking}

Without knowledge of the internals of a method, it must be assumed that all "action method"
calls to a state element conflict.  In addition, it must be assumed that all "value method" calls
must preceed all "action method" calls in any clock cycle.

Since method/method conflicts in a module cannot be validated in the absence of
information about their usage, this processing is delayed until the "module group binding"
stage of linking.
(It is not possible to resolve these conflicts standalone in the instantiated module.)

The linker cannot break any loops, but can only report on errors that are non-DAG.

Memoize checked results.

\rSec2[atomicc.schedfuture]{Future directions in scheduling}

It is possible to create new rules that 'read' the 'commit value' for a state element.
This would be done by synthesising a new 'combined rule' and scheduling it \cite{Rosenband:Thesis}.

\rSec2[atomicc.schedprev]{Previous scheduling work}

In the Esposito Scheduler\cite{Esposito:Patent},
the Bluespec compiler creates a specific, linear schedule, adding
one rule at a time.  When a rule violates constraints from the previously scheduled
rules, an error is issued and an automatic guard is synthesised to prevent the
rule from executing on cycles when conflicting rules are executed.

Since the rules are added to the schedule approximately in the order they are
found in the source program text, the resulting schedule (and which rules are
inhibited) can be affected by source ordering and edits.

\rSec1[atomicc.modcomp]{Compilation}

The AtomicC compiler generates a separate Verilog module definition
for each source AtomicC module definition.
This verilog source defines the state elements
used in the design as well as their connections (netlist).

Modules independently compiled.  Combined with "linking", which validates schedule using header files.

Physical partitioning is used to separate design into separately synthesized pieces, connected using
"long distance" signalling.  Parallel synthesis; bitstreams combined.

AtomicC execution consists of 3 phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item static elaboration: netlist generation, 
\item netlist compilation or implementation
\item and runtime.
\end{itemize}

During netlist
generation, modules are instantiated by executing their
constructors. During this phase, any C++ constructs may be used, but
the resulting netlist must only contain synthesizeable components.

During netlist compilation, the netlist is analyzed and translated to
an intermediate representation and then to Verilog for simulation or
synthesis. Alternate translations are possible: to native code via
LLVM, to System C, to Gallina for formal verification with the Coq
Proof Assistant, etc.
