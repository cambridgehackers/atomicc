Rules specify the behavior with a design. A rule operates
transactionally: when a rule's guard and the guards of all of its
method invocations are satisfied, then it is ready to fire. It will be
fire on a clock cycle when it does not conflict with any higher
priority rule. A rule executes atomically.

\begin{example}
\begin{codeblock}
     // default guard is true
     __rule respond_rule {
         fifo->out.deq();
         ind->heard(fifo->out.first());
     }
\end{codeblock}
\end{example}
