Examples of how scheduling is computed

In the following examples, there are 3 rules: RuleA, RuleB and RuleC.
There are 3 state elements: E1, E2 and E3.

\end{importgraphic}

A simple SC example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schedule1}.  
The schedule sequence is {A, B, C}.

\begin{importgraphic}
{non-SC ordering example}
{fig:schedule2}
{figschedule2.pdf}
\end{importgraphic}

A non-SC example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:schedule2}.
There is no linear sequence of the rules that preserves read-before-write for all
state elements.
